        //ALL Virus names, and then another one to get descriptions and so on,

        //essentially creating a class for "Name" and another for "desc" then having those classes store the results in an array, then scrubbing through
        //those arrays to get the details, (for i.....) getVirusName(i),  getVirusDes(i)



        //Chestens notes
        //Further implementation can be done here to assign things like the icon type.
        //I beleive if this holds all the data that we need about one virus, I will be able
        //to take this one element, and parse it out in the view.
