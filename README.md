# Cybersecurity Malware Analysis Dashboard
Using a common malware web tool called VirusTotal, you can directly work with their API to grab information about different files and malware that is uploaded, and has been scanned by many different malware protection softwares (Symantec, MacAfee, etc.). Using their API, our goal would be to create a Cybersecurity Malware Analysis dashboard, that analyzes not only the malware that is coming in, but also to establish trends and relationships about current Malware that is occurring. We will be able to provide objective data and metrics that are useful, but also be able to look at current trends and see where malware may be headed, to stay as proactive as possible.
